# Configuration for new node.js project

## Creating a new project
Simply run `sh create-new-node-project.sh`, and a new pre-configured node.js project will show up in a directory called `new-node-project/`.

To run your new application, simply run `npm start`.

## Additional setup

* Edit the "name", "description", and "author" fields of `package.json` as needed.
* The new project comes with a git repo with the current setup as the first commit. Add a remote and push.
